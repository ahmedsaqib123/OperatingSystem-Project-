Using the concept of multiprogramming, comparing three sorting algorithms based upon how much time will they take when implemented on each of the three techniques i.e. Serial (Sequential C++ Programming) , PThreads and, OpenMP and then conclude each of them.

Algorithms:
1.	Merge Sort
2.	Quick Sort
3.	Heap Sort
Tools:
Language: C++
Platform: Oracle VM VirtualBox
System: Ubuntu 

Compile And Run: 
gcc -o HeapSerial HeapSerial.cpp -lstdc++ or g++ -o HeapSerial HeapSerial.cpp 
Therefore, we use –lstdc++ to link the C++ code to the compiler.
